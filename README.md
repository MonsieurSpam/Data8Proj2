# Data8Proj2 

Resources needed to run Project 2 in Google Collab  

## How to use 
In python notebook, include a !git clone <URL> to include the files in this repo. This should import all files into the Google Colab runtime environment. 
Drag and drop all files outside of the folder so there are locatable by the .ipynb cells.

## Known issues 
Unfortunately, even when you use this repo the otter-autograder isn't compatible with it.
